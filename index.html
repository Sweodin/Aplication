        <p class="card-text">
          After years in traditional roles, I seized the chance to pursue my
          dream of a career in technology. I began my journey with front-end
          development, studying at Sundsgården, and now have plans to expand
          into full-stack development. To build a successful career and fully
          leverage my education, I’m committed to mastering backend development
          as well. This year, while attending Sundsgården, I co-founded Twin
          Logic Tech with a like-minded partner. Together, we focus on
          delivering high-quality IT services for businesses, ranging from
          website development and security to full-scale tech installations. Our
          mission is to create impactful, client-centered solutions that empower
          companies to grow in today’s fast-paced digital landscape. As the tech
          industry advances rapidly, I’m eager to be part of the innovation
          driving this new era of IT. Having faced the challenges of ADHD from a
          young age, I’m particularly motivated to create a company that values
          individuality and embraces different working styles. I want Twin Logic
          Tech to be a place where people understand and support each other,
          allowing us to work in ways that are effective and true to who we are.

        <p class="card-text">
          I'm Peter Gustafsson, a passionate tech enthusiast born in 1985 and a
          proud family man. From a young age, computers have fascinated me. At
          16, I built my first computer and began creating websites for games
          and friends. Despite facing challenges with ADHD and a lack of formal
          support, I continued to nurture my passion for technology, driven by
          an inner curiosity and desire to learn. Throughout my youth, computers
          became a source of calm and focus, helping me channel my energy and
          organize my thoughts. Gaming was my gateway, where I honed my skills
          and developed the focus that allowed me to reach elite levels in
          competitive play. As I grew older and life demanded new ways to find
          balance, I turned to riding motorbikes, which provided a physical
          outlet to clear my mind when time didn't allow for extended gaming
          sessions. I’ve also been a lifelong stuntman, taking on daring feats
          like jumping from heights, hanging from helicopters, and even being
          set on fire. This adventurous spirit—both behind the screen and in
          action—has fueled my determination to forge a career in tech and
          pursue my entrepreneurial goals. My journey took a pivotal turn when I
          moved with my family to Helsingborg. With the support of my family and
          the encouragement of a childhood friend who never gave up on me, I
          began ADHD medication, and the results were transformative. My grades
          and focus in school improved dramatically, reaching levels I hadn’t
          thought possible. My family and friend’s unwavering belief in
          me—especially during times when teachers or employers dismissed my
          potential—motivated me to push myself and explore new possibilities in
          tech. Now, I’m seizing the opportunity to build a career in IT and am
          dedicated to creating an innovative, dynamic tech company. This year,
          I co-founded Twin Logic Tech with a like-minded partner, focusing on
          delivering high-quality IT services for businesses. From website
          development and security to full-scale tech installations, our mission
          is to empower businesses with solutions that help them thrive in a
          rapidly evolving digital world. As technology advances at an
          unprecedented pace, I’m excited to contribute to this new era of IT.
          With a strong foundation of skills, a supportive family, and the
          determination to make a meaningful impact, I am committed to making
          Twin Logic Tech a company that values individual strengths and
          embraces the diverse ways people work best. This journey is just
          beginning, and I look forward to the challenges and achievements ahead
          as I pursue my vision for a successful, people-centered business in
          the tech industry.

        <h2 class="card-headline">Why I Would Be a Good Future Developer</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          My lifelong passion for technology and self-driven learning has built
          a strong foundation for my journey as a developer. From building my
          first computer at 16 and designing websites to achieving elite levels
          in gaming, I’ve developed a keen understanding of technology.
          Computers and gaming have been my outlet, helping me focus and channel
          my thoughts, especially as I’ve learned to manage ADHD. As I’ve gained
          more insight into ADHD and how to control it, my ability to learn and
          absorb information has significantly improved, further sharpening my
          skills as a developer. Since moving to Helsingborg and starting ADHD
          medication, my school performance and focus have reached new heights,
          proving my adaptability and resilience. Now, as co-founder of Twin
          Logic Tech, I’m dedicated to creating innovative, high-quality IT
          solutions. My unique journey fuels my commitment to building a
          dynamic, people-centered company that brings real value to the tech
          world.

        <h2 class="card-headline">Previous Front-end Development Experience</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          Before starting at Sundsgården as a front-end developer, I had already
          been honing my skills through online courses for about a year. These
          courses allowed me to build a strong foundation in front-end
          technologies and gain practical experience. Now, at Sundsgården, I’m
          further developing my skills with hands-on projects and structured
          learning. This combination of self-study and formal education has
          equipped me with a solid understanding of front-end development and
          prepared me for real-world applications in the field.

            >Countdown_timer</a
          >
          This one-hour countdown timer, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          provides an easy-to-read HH:MM:SS display and straightforward user
          controls. The timer starts from 1:00:00 (1 hour, 0 minutes, 0 seconds)
          and counts down to zero, with three buttons—Start, Stop, and Reset—to
          control the countdown.
          <b>Display and Initialization</b>
          The HTML structure includes placeholders for hours, minutes, and
          seconds, formatted to show two digits each (e.g., 01:05:09). The timer
          starts at 1:00:00, displayed through JavaScript’s padStart() method,
          which ensures each unit is consistently two digits for readability.
          <b>Starting the Countdown</b>
          When the Start button is clicked, a JavaScript setInterval function
          begins the countdown, decrementing every second. During the countdown,
          mySeconds decreases first; when it reaches zero, myMinutes decreases,
          resetting mySeconds to 59. This pattern repeats, ensuring smooth time
          transitions until reaching 0:00:00. The timer then stops, re-enabling
          the Start button.
          <b> Pausing and Resetting</b>
          The Stop button pauses the countdown by clearing the interval,
          allowing users to resume from where they left off. The Reset button
          completely stops the countdown, resets the display to 1:00:00, and
          disables Stop and Reset, preparing the timer for a fresh start.
          <b>Summary</b>
          This timer is user-friendly and reliable, with a consistent display
          and simple controls. The Start, Stop, and Reset buttons provide
          flexibility for timed activities, making it a versatile tool for
          productivity or general timing needs. Whether users need to track one
          hour or pause and resume, this timer offers the essential features in
          a clean, easy-to-use interface.
